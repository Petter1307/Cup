# Cup
Learning OOP in C++. It`s an useless program that I made to learn OOP in C++. Nothing really interesting just a program that creates cups. 
1. How I got this idea ?  <br />
- Just saw a cup on the table and implemented some features of a ceramic cup. 
2. How far I want to go with this program ? <br />
 - I dunno. I will see how far I will go.
## SIDE NOTE
- This program was shared with other studets from my class. Its free of charge, open source, do whatever you want to do with it.
